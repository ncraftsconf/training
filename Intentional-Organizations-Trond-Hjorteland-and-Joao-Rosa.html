                                    <h3>Breaking the bureaucracy: realigning organizational structures for self-managing teams and effective technology fit</h3>
                                    <h5>Teaser</h5>
                                    <p>
                                        Do you find it hard to constantly adapt and evolve in a fast-changing and increasingly unpredictable world? Do you struggle with the complexity of software development, the difficulty of evolving your architecture, and the rising cost of change? Did you experience “agile” or technological transformations that didn’t deliver the promised benefits? You are not alone. In this 2-day workshop, we will explore how to realign organizational structures that put the people in the center of the design and allow teams to have agency and autonomy.
                                    </p> 
                                    <h5>Summary</h5>
                                    <p>
                                        In this 2-day workshop, you will experience, through real-world simulations, how your company can harness the power of the people to create a sensible organizational design that allows teams to self-manage and optimize the use of technology. The workshop is based on open systems thinking, and rather than the typical theory and lectures, it is a 2-days simulation that will take you on a journey of organization design with effective technology integration.                                    
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        You will learn how to recognize the impact of the environment on a sociotechnical system and create evolutionary paths for the team structures and its technology. The open systems thinking principles and practices will be applied to create a more effective and resilient organization, regardless of whether you are technical or not.                                    
                                    </p>
                                    <p>This workshop is suitable for anyone responsible for making any decisions about an organization's design (business, product, and IT).</p>

                                    <h5>What is this workshop about</h5>
                                    <p>
                                        The world is constantly changing, and software plays an ever-increasing role in this change. Companies that leverage technology, such as software, are under pressure to adapt to an unpredictable world. To support a fast flow of change, we can’t just apply the old methods that don’t support the organization's adaptability and treat it as an open and exposed system. We might recognise some consequences of those old methods: accidental complexity keeps growing in your software, people find it incredibly difficult to evolve the system, and the cost of change is rising exponentially. Last but not least, the pressure on people is increasing, and their well-being is at odds with technical progress; burnout and absenteeism are rising, and firms need to retain their talents.                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In this workshop, we will explore open sociotechnical systems thinking, which gives equal weight to social and technological aspects and puts people back in the centre of the design. This approach profoundly impacts how we do architecture and organise people to deliver value. We will combine the open sociotechnical systems theory principles with Domain-Driven Design, Wardley Maps, and Team Topologies. By combining those principles and practices, we will explore the environment around the organisation, discover and discuss sensible boundaries for the teams and architecture, and generate options for the evolution of the sociotechnical system.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This workshop is not only based on scientific research, but it is also a 2-day simulation. You will be given a real-world problem, and you will progress through the workshop with support from the facilitators. You will be exposed to the necessary theory as the simulation unfolds, and we will have opportunities to explore your own challenges.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Whether you are an organizational coach, software engineer, or manager, this workshop is for you. Join us and learn how to apply these concepts, principles, and practices to create a more effective, resilient, and adaptive organisation. You will be able to apply it to your context and support your team and organization to have a human-centric design.                                    </p>
